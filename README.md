# Kotlin Playground

The aim is to have as many examples related to different kotlin concepts keeping in mind readability, code cleanliness and documentation. 

#### Guidelines to write code:
1) Each concept will have a folder directly under src. The naming of the folder should be strictly in camelCase ex. helloWorld
2) Each concept folder can have any number of files but the main file that will start the code execution should be named "app.kt". This means each fold
er will have minimum one file that will be app.kt
3) Each file, function needs to be properly documented as per [KDoc](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/kotlin-doc.html) guidelines.
4) A concept folder cannot have sub folders
5) A concept folder should not access a files outside it's scope ie folder A should not access files from folder B. This keeps code simple and helps in understanding.
6) If refering to any external blog or documentation, please do add the links in the specific file.
7) Ensure code is properly formatted before push.
8) Each concept should be a branch of it's own checked out from "master" branch.
9) Request for a PR to merge into master.
10) Create Wiki(s) in the repository to attach anything interesting you may find online or in general add your observations/experiances.
